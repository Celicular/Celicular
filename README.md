Hello guys,
This is my kinda first project on github and I hope you guys will like it.

You guys may use this product by downloading it and then running the files in the 'dist" folder .

Useful steps ðŸ‘Ž<br>
on running main.exe you will find that a folder will get created. You have to add your video file in that folder (only one at a time) and don't forget to name it "video.mp4"
because its kind off necessary else your video will not get detected and hence might cause some trouble. 

after adding the video file to your folder, just run main.exe again and it will do everything that is required and give you the desired output in the folder that
the exe file is in.
